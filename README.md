## Exp 1 Mode Characteristics of Fiber Optic Cable
## 🎯 AIM
To study the mode characteristics of fiber optic cable and observe the lower order Linearly Polarized (LP) modes.

## 🧰 EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED
LASER Source (633 nm – 1mW)
Source to Fiber Coupler
Single Mode Fiber
Fiber Holding Stand
Opaque Screen
## 📚 THEORY
The central spot carries 95% of the intensity for laser beams with Gaussian profile. I = Ioe-2(r / w) ^2 where e = 2.718 is the base of the natural logarithm. An accepted definition of a radius of a Gaussian beam is t 0.135 times its peak value Io. This radius is called spot size. The spot diameter is w. Spot Diameter (d) micron = Focal length of the Lens (f) mm x Laser beam full divergence angle (DA) mrad. In order to achieve maximum coupling efficiency, the fiber core diameter has to be bigger than the spot diameter. NA rays = Laser Beam Diameter (B.D.) 2 x Lens Focal Length (f) The source coupler is comprised of two base plates. One of the base plates contains a focusing lens and a female connector receptacle. The other base plate is attached onto the laser. An O-ring is sandwiched between the base plates. Threaded screws interconnect the two base plates. A screw driver to alter the angular orientation of one base plate relative to the other can then adjust the screws.

The number of modes propagating through the fiber depends on V-number. If the fiber whose number is less than 2.045, it allows to propagate single mode through it, so it is called as Single Mode fiber. A Multimode fiber, V-number is slightly greater than 2.045 but the number of allowed modes is small enough that they may be individually identified when the output of the fiber is examined. When V < 2.045, then only a single mode may propagate in the fiber waveguide. This mode is HE11 mode or LP01 – Linearly Polarized mode. When V > 2.045, other modes may propagate, when V is slightly greater than 2.045 i.e. V = 4.91 then 4 Linearly Polarized modes will propagate through fiber.

## 🧪 PROCEDURE
Keep the optical bread board on a flat and stable table surface so that it will not toggle.

Fix the pre-fitted cylindrical head of the He-Ne laser source onto the surface of the bread board and confirm the rigidity of the mount.

Fix the laser to the fiber coupler mount on the bread board with the base plate oriented towards the He-Ne laser exit.

Turn on the He-Ne laser and locate the beam spot on the central portion of the laser-fiber coupling lens assembly by adjusting the vertical and horizontal travel arrangements. Tighten the screws after alignment.

Look for the back reflection of the He-Ne laser spot from the rod lens of the coupler. If the back-reflected spot is away from the exit of the cylindrical laser head, slowly adjust the four screws on the laser mount to bring it back into the exit hole.

Confirm the central alignment of the laser beam at the exit of the laser fiber coupler using a white card sheet. If the spot is off-center, slightly adjust the screws of the laser mount.

Connect the multimode optical patch cord to the laser fiber coupler exit and fix the other end of the fiber in the fiber-holding stand using the grub screws.

Observe the bright laser beam coming out of the fiber and adjust the exit tip height to at least 50 mm above the white sheet.

Observe the bright circular spot with a laser speckle pattern on the screen. Refine the multimode pattern using the screws on the laser-fiber coupler. After observation, replace the multimode patch cord with a single-mode fiber patch cord.

For the single-mode patch cord, observe the blur patterns such as single circular, two-lobe, three-lobe, and four-lobe patterns by slightly adjusting the Allen screws of the laser-fiber coupler.
